# samsoff.es

This is my new blog I am rewriting in Rails. I [moved my blog to Jekyll](http://samsoff.es/post/new-blog-on-github-and-jekyll/) a few weeks ago and really missed playing with a Rails app, so I'm moving it back and starting from scratch.

My current blog is still at <http://samsoff.es>. You can see this version at <http://samsoffes.heroku.com> until I make it live.

### Goals for new version

* Use [Heroku](http://heroku.com) for hosting
* Use [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) for integration testing
* New design
* Cleaner backend
* Categories
* New homepage
* Integrate podcast into app
* Support old URLs and move to new restful URLs
