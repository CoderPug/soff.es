  <div class="content">
    <p>This week I have a talk at the first <a href="http://cocoaokc.org">Oklahoma City CocoaHeads</a> meeting. I was going to talk about transferring data from web services with plists. I spend most of the day working on SSConnection, my simple Foundation class for easily transferring plist data from a web service to a Cocoa application.</p>

<p>I was so into plists because at the Austin iPhone Tech talk I attended, they encouraged you to transfer data in plists because it had native parsing. I have to admit the native parsing is quite awesome. One method and everything is all parsed and ready.</p>

<p>I was using <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> (javascript object notation) to transfer everything with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework">JSON Framework</a>. I had started switching everything to use plists. I spend a ton of time writing a PHP class to convert arrays to and from plist strings.</p>

<p>When I was preparing for my talk I decided to do some benchmarks to show how much more awesome plists were than JSON. The plist version was about 8 times faster than my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework">JSON Framework</a> version. I was pretty happy with that result. My friend, <a href="http://twitter.com/withfoam">Jake</a>, said he was using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/touchcode/">TouchJSON</a> to parse JSON in his apps, so I figured I'd go ahead and benchmark that one too. I was expecting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework">JSON Framework</a> to beat it because the interface to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework">JSON Framework</a> is a lot simpler than the interface to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/touchcode/">TouchJSON</a>.</p>

<p>What I found was <strong>very</strong> surprising. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/touchcode/">TouchJSON</a> actually beat plists. It was slightly faster in every test I ran. This is awesome because plists have a much larger file size. They are usually about twice as big as JSON files due to all of the extra markup.</p>

<p>I am keeping everything using JSON now instead of switching to plist. JSON will transfer twice as fast and parse faster than plists do. Awesome.</p>

<p>Sorry to everyone I preached plists to. I assumed Apple would be correct. They were not.</p>

<p><strong>Update 10/29/09:</strong> Several people have suggested using binary plists instead, as they are actually much smaller than XML. I chose the XML style ones because they were much easier to manipulate. Hopefully there is an implementation of <code>plutil -convert</code> for Ruby out there.</p>
