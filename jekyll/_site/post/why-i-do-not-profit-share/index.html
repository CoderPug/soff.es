  <div class="content">
    <p>As a freelancer, I get a lot of people pitch me ideas they want me to work on. On average, I get one of these ideas pitched to me every two days. This is great. I am always looking for something to work on.</p>

<p>Almost all of these app ideas are iPhone apps. I welcome iPhone work as I absolutely love the platform. For the first time I had a client want to profit share with me. They wanted to work on an idea they probably spent a few hours on for weeks and then share all of the profit with me. There are several reasons why I do not do this, ever.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am fully capable of coming up with my own ideas and then getting all of the money. Why would I work on the customer's idea that I'm less passionate about and get half of the money?</p></li>
<li><p>If the customer really believed in their idea, they should take out a business loan and pay me the small amount of money compared to what they will make if their ideas is as good as they think it is.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a bad idea for the customer because I will be way less motivated to work on something with future compensation that I may never receive.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So if you are thinking of asking me to work on your idea and cannot pay half upfront (as well as the remainder of course), then do not contact me because I will not work on your idea.</p>
