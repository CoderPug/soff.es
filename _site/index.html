  <div class="content">
    <p>Lately I've been trying to teach <a href="http://twitter.com/haileyjayne">an awesome friend</a> front-end web development. It's so hard to even know where to begin.</p>

<h3>The good ole days</h3>

<p>I started writing HTML when I was 10 years old. Back then, it was easy. We were writing our tags in all caps (HOW AWFUL), not closing tags if we didn't feel like it, frames were regarded as professional, and the animated gif was cool (<a href="http://sammcd.com">some</a> would say <a href="http://assets.samsoff.es/posts/trying-to-teach-web-development/it-isnt.gif">it still is</a>).</p>

<p>I remember when Javascript became popular and <a href="http://javascriptkit.com">JavascriptKit.com</a> was the place to get copy and paste scripts for your site. I can remember when CSS started to become popular and when table layouts finally died out. It was easy to pick stuff. The technologies evolved at the rate that I learned them (which was awesome).</p>

<p>Trying to start from scratch today is pretty difficult. Things are a lot easier than they used to be (especially if you're using frameworks and such), but there is so much knowledge that you need to acquire before you can be a useful web developer.</p>

<h3>It's possible</h3>

<p>After a few hours typing HTML and CSS, she started to pick it up. I told her to reference <a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> and the mighty <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>. I'm pretty confident that with today's resources and some perseverance, it's possible to get started pretty quickly.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I posted a <a href="/post/easy-deployment-with-heroku">screencast on Heroku</a> a few months ago. Since then, <a href="http://tastefulworks.com">my company</a> has moved all of their stuff to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. It has been working really great for us.</p>

<p>I've had my blog <a href="/post/new-blog-on-github-and-jekyll">on GitHub pages</a> for awhile. I recently came across a <a href="http://jstorimer.com/2009/12/29/jekyll-on-heroku.html">good article</a> on running <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> from the <a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/42-episode-40-january-8-2010">Ruby5 podcast</a>. It was really easy to get setup. So far, I'm a fan of my new setup.</p>

<p>I'm still working on my <a href="http://github.com/samsoffes/samsoff.es/tree/rails3">Rails 3 version of my blog</a> when I have time. Lately, I've been playing a lot of music and occasionally dabbling with <a href="http://markdownr.com">Markdownr.com</a> due to a recent spike in traffic (<a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt/status/7491983993">thanks to @defunkt</a>).</p>

    <h2><a href="/post/app-store-rejection">App Store Rejection</a></h2>
    <p class="meta">Posted 03 Jan 2010</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>December was a month of rejection for me. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/x3watch/id337170101?mt=8">X3watch app</a> another of my client's apps, and <a href="http://lifechurch.tv">LifeChurch.tv</a>'s <a href="http://youversion.com/iphone">Bible app</a> (which I wrote most of but am no longer a part of) got rejected.</p>

<h3>What Changed</h3>

<p><em>Apple changed the rules recently</em>, which is fine. They change the App Store every month or so. Normally, you just click accept to the new terms and go about your business. Do you ever read EULAs? I don't. Basically the same thing.</p>

<p>The important change to note (that they obviously didn't highlight, but expected you to read the massive terms in legal speak) was their new policy on undocumented APIs. Before, <em>private APIs</em> were not allowed and <em>undocumented APIs</em> were just frowned upon but still allowed.</p>

<h4>The Difference Between Private and Undocumented</h4>

<p>Private APIs are basically anything in a Private Framework (found in <code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks</code> on the device) like <a href="http://samsoff.es/post/parsing-json-with-the-iphones-private-json-framework/"><code>JSON.framework</code></a> or <code>XMPP.framework</code>. Undocumented APIs are APIs found in one of the public frameworks (found in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks</code> on the device) that are not in the header files or documentations. (You go about finding this with a neat tool called <a href="http://www.codethecode.com/projects/class-dump/">class-dump</a>).</p>

<h3>Why Apple Did This</h3>

<p>Apple's rules for the App Store are intended to keep the apps in it good and the garbage out (one could argue to make developers lives horribly, but I'll leave that to your judgement). The reason for an API being undocumented is that Apple could change it whenever they want because they haven't taken the time to really finalize it. This means that an update could break your app because they changed something. They don't want apps that will randomly break on updates in the store, I get that.</p>

<h3>Why I Care So Much</h3>

<p>I understand Apple's reasoning for this, but I don't like it. There are a lot of things that many apps rely on that are undocumented. Even worse, Apple will let <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/google_mobile_uses_private_iphone_apis">certain apps use undocumented APIs</a> which is so unfair. <em>We just want consistency Apple.</em></p>

<p>All of the apps that I mentioned earlier that got rejected, got rejected for <code>UIWebView</code> (the view that shows Safari-like content in an app) undocumented APIs. <a href="http://youversion.com/iphone">Bible</a> was using undocumented methods for scrolling. Without the use of these undocumented APIs, the ability to scroll the webview without the user is impossible. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/x3watch/id337170101?mt=8">X3watch</a> got rejected for the same thing undocumented API (as well their keywords). My other client's app got rejected for disabling the scrolling of a webview with an undocumented API. So frustrating.</p>

<h3>One Warning</h3>

<p>I contacted my friends at <a href="http://lifechurch.tv">LifeChurch.tv</a> when the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/x3watch/id337170101?mt=8">X3watch</a> app got rejected, because I remembered using very similar undocumented APIs in <a href="http://youversion.com/iphone">Bible</a> when I was still working on it. They informed me that they were rejected for using the undocumented APIs that I mentioned earlier. A few minutes later, they received an approval email saying their app had been approved and that they needed to take out the undocumented APIs before submitting another update or it would not be allowed into the store.</p>

<p>I guess it's kinda cool that Apple gives you a little grace if you were already in the store. My client and the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/x3watch/id337170101?mt=8">X3watch app</a> weren't already in the store, so they were just rejected.</p>

<h3>Thoughts To Apple</h3>

<p>Apple, a lot of developers rely on undocumented APIs. We understand why you won't allow them. We are just ask that you start documenting popular ones. I know a lot of people really want so see the scrolling and <code>UIScroller</code> in <code>UIWebView</code> documented, methods in <code>UIApplication</code> for airplane mode prompts, and many others. Please start an effort to documented these methods. Any effort to try to more clearly communicate App Store policy changes like this besides having us read the massive agreement would also be very welcome.</p>
