<h3>Where I Work</h3>
<p>I was a developer at an amazing church called <a href="http://lifechurch.tv" rel="external nofollow">LifeChurch.tv</a>. I wrote <a href="http://youversion.com/iphone" rel="external nofollow">iPhone</a> and web software. I was working on an iPhone application called <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=282935706&#038;mt=8" rel="external nofollow">Bible</a>. It combines the power of <a href="http://youversion.com" rel="external nofollow">YouVersion.com</a> with the iPhone OS to make a pretty sweet app.</p>

<p>Now I do freelance Mac, iPhone, and web development full time. <a href="http://iturndreamsintosoftware.com/">Hire me.</a></p>

<p>I also run a small Mac software company called <a href="http://trimonix.com" rel="external nofollow">Trimonix</a>. We have a little app that makes creating countdown videos super easy called <a href="http://trimonix.com/countdown-maker" rel="external nofollow">Countdown Maker</a>. Check it out if you get a minute.</p>

<h3>Stuff I Like</h3>
<p>I really enjoy making things, notably <a href="http://trimonix.com" rel="external nofollow">software</a> and <a href="http://dev.samsoff.es/music">music</a>. I play drums in this awesome band called <a href="http://hollowtheband.com/" rel="external nofollow">Hollow</a>. It's a lot of fun. I'm also a huge Apple fan and really enjoy writing Mac/iPhone software. Quartz Composer is a piece of Apple technology that I am particularly fond of.</p>
